Hi there!

I hope this email finds you well. I am a web/app developer here in Charleston and I noticed that Normandy Farm Artisan Bakery doesn't currently have a website. I wanted to reach out with an opportunity, as I run a web development business with a bit of a unique approach.

I design and build sites for local businesses like yours up front, taking on all the development risk myself, rather than asking businesses to pay before seeing results. I've gone ahead and created a fully functional website for Normandy Farm and would love to present it to you to see if it's a good fit!

Without knowing exactly what you're looking for, I went ahead and created a site featuring:

• Artisan bread, pastry, and coffee product showcases with online ordering capability
• Instagram feed integration to highlight your social media presence
• About section telling your unique bakery story and philosophy
• Contact information with hours, location, and inquiry form
• Modern, rustic design that matches your artisanal brand aesthetic
• Fully mobile-responsive layout that works on all devices

I attached some screenshots of the site in this email, as I know links from strangers are a bit worrisome nowadays! The site is fully functional and ready to go live, if you would like a link. I'd love to show you what I've created - no strings attached. If you like what you see, we can discuss next steps. If not, no worries at all!

Currently, there are placeholder images on the site. I would absolutely love to receive some real photos of your beautiful breads, pastries, and coffee to fill them in and give the site a more authentic, finalized look that truly showcases your artisanal products.

Best,
Justin Priede
